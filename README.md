# A Redesign of Nevada State Board of Accountancy of Website
### by Ted Song

## Introduction
This project was about evaluating a government website and redesigning it to enhance a user's experience of the website.
Given that government websites serve as an important hub for information, these websites must be accessible for all users.
These websites need to present information in a clear manner and be easily navigable.
For this project, I chose to study the [Nevada State Board of Accountancy](https://nvaccountancy.com/) website, which is used primarily by people and organizations that work specifically in public accounting.

## Design Statement
Because government websites are used by users who are familiar and users who are unfamiliar with the website, the goal was to redesign the website so that it would by easy to use for new users while still be familiar to users who already know how to use the website. I specifically wanted to focus on redesigning to make it friendly for new users because these users may be interested in working in public accounting and need to be able to find the information they need, but the current website fails to do this.

## Competitor Analysis
I conducted heuristic evaluations of two Nevada government websites. One of the websites was the Nevada State Board of Accountancy website. Overall, the website was simple in essence. However, the site had issues with recognition over recall and aesthetic/minimalistic design. Because there was so much information on the screen, the user would have to recall where certain features and links. Additionally, the site looked cluttered, which hampered an aesthetic and minimalistic design. The other website I evaluated was the [Nevada Gaming Commission and Gaming Control Board](https://gaming.nv.gov/index.aspx?page=1) website. In contrast, this website felt more welcoming in terms of design (though not in function) because it sports an organized look and a nice menu bar at the top. However, the website still struggled with accomodating for novices like the Nevada State Board of Accountancy website.

I also conducted a usability testing. The user was instructed to perform three tasks: filing a complaint on the website, renewing a CPA license, and finding the requirements to becoming a CPA. Overall, the user displayed confusion when navigating the website. At the end of the usability testing, the user described the website as boring, busy, and overwhelming. Some criticisms of the website were that it was unnecessarily complex, difficult to learn for new users, and cumbersome to use. However, some interesting positive points that the user raised was the website was overall simple and consistent.

## User Research
For the user research, I decided to conduct an interview 

## UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
Summary and link to your assignment folder

## Wireframe and graphic design element variation [assignment06 + part of 07]

## Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment06)
Summary and link to the sketches (may contains the multiple versions and evaluation history)

## High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
Summary statement and link to or an embedded prototype
